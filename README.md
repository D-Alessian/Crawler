# Rails Crawler

This project is a rails based web crawler that uses a website to add the links it needs to track, as well as other configuration options. 
This is meant to make it easy for your team to add websites it should track, with little technical knowledge.  
It will send a daily e-mail to a configured address detailing the changes made during that day.

## Setup

### Set up the environment variables

### Seed the Database
- Add the emails to the MailingList Table
